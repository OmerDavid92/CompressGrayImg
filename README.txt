# CompressGrayImg #
**This is my first year final Project   ;)

In this project We:
1. recieve a PGM file.  
2. Extract the pixel values of the image.
3. Change its pixel values using a particular algorithm.
4. Compress it into a bin file. 
5. There is an option to Uncompress the image back into PGM file.

**For further details please note GrayImage.pdf File
